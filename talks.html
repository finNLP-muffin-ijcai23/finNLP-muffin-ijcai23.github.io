        <h4>Title</h4>

        <p> The Evolution of Document Intelligence </p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>

        <p>
        Organizations often need to read, understand and interpret an ever-growing number of structured and unstructured business documents. In this talk I will start with an overview of document intelligence and discuss how methods for document analysis have evolved.  While many deep learning methods are available to solve natural language processing tasks, in enterprise applications it is critical to combine domain knowledge and deep learning. I will introduce DeepPSL, a method that encodes heuristics and other domain knowledge using probabilistic soft logic with predicates that can be deep learning models. I will then go through examples on document classification and entity resolution demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepPSL.

        <h4>Title</h4>

        <p> Natural Language Processing for Industrial Financial Predictive Analysis and Stock Trading </p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>

        <p>
          In the financial industry, risk modeling, trading strategy design, and profit generation heavily rely on accurately predicting stock movements. Stock movements are influenced by varied factors beyond the conventionally studied historical prices, such as social media and correlations among stocks. The rising ubiquity of online content and knowledge mandates an exploration of models that factor in such multimodal signals for accurate stock forecasting. In this talk, I introduce a set of modern AI and NLP-centric methods and techniques using alternate sources of data - social media text, financial disclosures, documents, and multimodal data such as audio from financial earnings calls for building financial models in the industry to trade across asset classes. I then delve into the architecture of these models - covering multimodal, sequential, and graph neural networks - and analyze them across a diverse spectrum of metrics through an industry lens - quantitative performance, profitability, qualitative analysis, computational complexity, gender bias, ethical implications and risks, and improvements over conventional financial predictive analysis methods.
